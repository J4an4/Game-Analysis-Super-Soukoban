## **Our Project**

We’re going to replicate the 1998 Super Soukoban game arcade version. This project has been done by two Catalan students of CITM - UPC (Terrassa, Spain).

## **Introduction**

Super Soukoban is a puzzle game developed by THINKING RABBIT and published by PACK-IN-VIDEO for the Super Nintendo in 1998. The main objective of the game is to move boxes to designated locations within each level using the fewest possible moves. This game combines strategy and logic, making it perfect for those who enjoy mental challenges.
